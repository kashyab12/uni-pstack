# Outcome-Oriented Execution
## Uni-pstack Runtime Adapter

This is a portable port of upstream Cursor pstack. Apply these overrides before following the original workflow:

- Cursor Task or subagent calls mean Codex delegation. In Codex, use native Codex subagents. In Claude Code, launch Codex CLI workers using the installed pstack skill spawn-codex-worker script or direct codex exec.
- Replace upstream Composer, Claude Opus, and other panel defaults with Codex gpt-5.5 high reasoning plus the supported fast or priority tier for Codex work.
- In Claude Code only, if a task explicitly needs a Claude-only worker instead of Codex, use Fable 5 high. For Claude-only UI or UX judgment, use Fable 5 high for hard calls and medium for cheaper iteration. Do not apply Fable guidance inside Codex-hosted runs.
- Cursor-only commands such as loop, babysit, deslop, control-ui, and control-cli are conceptual cues. Use the host terminal, browser, review, subagent, and git tools directly.
- Cursor paths become host-appropriate project or user configuration paths. Preserve the workflow intent, not Cursor-specific storage.


Optimize for the intended, verifiable end state rather than preserving smooth intermediate states.

**Why:** Keeping every intermediate step fully stable often creates temporary compatibility code that becomes long-lived debt. Converge on the target architecture and prove correctness at explicit verification boundaries.

**Core rule:**
- Prioritize end-state integrity over transitional stability
- Intermediate breakage is acceptable when it is planned, scoped, and reversible
- Always run final verification before declaring done

**Guardrails:**
- Use this for planned rewrites and migrations with explicit phase boundaries
- Declare where temporary breakage is acceptable
- Keep high-signal checks for actively touched areas while migrating
- Require full static and runtime verification at plan completion
