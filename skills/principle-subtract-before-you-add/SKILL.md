# Subtract Before You Add
## Uni-pstack Runtime Adapter

This is a portable port of upstream Cursor pstack. Apply these overrides before following the original workflow:

- Cursor Task or subagent calls mean Codex delegation. In Codex, use native Codex subagents. In Claude Code, launch Codex CLI workers using the installed pstack skill spawn-codex-worker script or direct codex exec.
- Replace upstream Composer, Claude Opus, and other panel defaults with Codex gpt-5.6-sol and task-appropriate reasoning: medium for routine implementation and exploration; high for judgment, synthesis, and high-risk work. Use the supported fast or priority tier.
- Claude-only fallback model policy lives in the installed pstack delegation reference. Do not infer Claude model choices from this skill.
- Cursor-only commands such as loop, babysit, deslop, control-ui, and control-cli are conceptual cues. Use the host terminal, browser, review, subagent, and git tools directly.
- Cursor paths become host-appropriate project or user configuration paths. Preserve the workflow intent, not Cursor-specific storage.


When evolving a system, remove complexity first, then build. Deletion gives you a simpler base, which makes the next addition smaller and less brittle.

**Why:** Adding to a complex system compounds complexity. Removing first cuts the surface area, reveals the essential structure, and usually makes the next design obvious. Default to subtraction.

**The pattern:**
- Sequence removal before construction
- Cut before you polish (get to the minimum before investing in quality)
- Design for observed usage, not speculative edge cases
- No speculative validators, parsers, or guards beyond what the spec demands
- Out-of-spec features drag validators behind them. Persistence, retry-on-startup, and schema migration each need guards to defend their inputs.
- Simplify prompts (remove redundant instructions, excessive templates)
- When a reference has no novel content, delete it rather than leaving a stub
