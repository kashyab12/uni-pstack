# Exhaust the Design Space
## Uni-pstack Runtime Adapter

This is a portable port of upstream Cursor pstack. Apply these overrides before following the original workflow:

- Cursor Task or subagent calls mean Codex delegation. In Codex, use native Codex subagents. In Claude Code, launch Codex CLI workers using the installed pstack skill spawn-codex-worker script or direct codex exec.
- Replace upstream Composer, Claude Opus, and other panel defaults with Codex gpt-5.5 high reasoning plus the supported fast or priority tier for Codex work.
- In Claude Code only, if a task explicitly needs a Claude-only worker instead of Codex, use Fable 5 high. For Claude-only UI or UX judgment, use Fable 5 high for hard calls and medium for cheaper iteration. Do not apply Fable guidance inside Codex-hosted runs.
- Cursor-only commands such as loop, babysit, deslop, control-ui, and control-cli are conceptual cues. Use the host terminal, browser, review, subagent, and git tools directly.
- Cursor paths become host-appropriate project or user configuration paths. Preserve the workflow intent, not Cursor-specific storage.


When a novel interaction or architectural decision has no established precedent, explore several concrete alternatives before implementation. Building the wrong thing costs more than exploring three options.

**The rule:** When the right answer is not obvious, build 2-3 competing prototypes or sketches. Compare them side by side. Only then commit.

**When it applies:**
- Novel UI interactions (no prior art in the codebase)
- Architectural choices with multiple viable approaches
- Product design decisions where user experience depends on feel, not logic

**When it doesn't:**
- Mechanical implementation where the pattern is established
- Bug fixes or refactors with a clear target state
- Changes where constraints dictate a single viable approach
