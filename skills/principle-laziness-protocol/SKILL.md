# Laziness Protocol
## Uni-pstack Runtime Adapter

This is a portable port of upstream Cursor pstack. Apply these overrides before following the original workflow:

- Cursor Task or subagent calls mean Codex delegation. In Codex, use native Codex subagents. In Claude Code, launch Codex CLI workers using the installed pstack skill spawn-codex-worker script or direct codex exec.
- Replace upstream Composer, Claude Opus, and other panel defaults with Codex gpt-5.5 high reasoning plus the supported fast or priority tier for Codex work.
- Claude-only fallback model policy lives in the installed pstack delegation reference. Do not infer Claude model choices from this skill.
- Cursor-only commands such as loop, babysit, deslop, control-ui, and control-cli are conceptual cues. Use the host terminal, browser, review, subagent, and git tools directly.
- Cursor paths become host-appropriate project or user configuration paths. Preserve the workflow intent, not Cursor-specific storage.


Writing code is cheap for you, which makes over-engineering easy. Counter it by borrowing a human maintainer's fatigue. Aim for the most result with the least code and complexity.

- **Prefer deletion.** When asked to refactor or improve, look for removals before additions.
- **Maintain a flat hierarchy.** Avoid deep abstractions. If answering a question requires tracing through more than 3 files or layers, flatten it.
- **Consolidate decisions.** Do not repeat the same choice in several places. Put it behind one source of truth and pass the result as a simple flag.
- **Minimize the diff.** Make the smallest change that solves the problem. Fewer lines beat "elegant" boilerplate.
- **Question the threading.** If a task asks you to pass a new signal through types, schemas, pipelines, or similar layers, stop and look for a more direct path.

**Prime directive:** If a human developer would find the code exhausting to maintain, it is a bad solution. Be lazy. Stay simple.
